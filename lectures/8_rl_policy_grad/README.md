This lecture introduces a more theoretically sound reinforcement learning algorithm called policy gradient and it's improvements based on advantage function (advantage actor-critic).

The two notebooks in this folder are seminar/homework assignments. Please start with `intro_policy_gradient.ipynb`.

Both notebooks utilize theano/lasagne. If you're unfamiliar with the two, try [this tutorial week](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/tree/master/week3.5).

As usual, we recommend using binder during the seminar:  [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/justheuristic/practical_rl)  (press me).

To run it locally, you will require
- basic python data science setup (numpy, scipy, sklearn)
- openai gym 
  - on most OSes you can simply ```pip install gym```
  - [detailed guide](https://github.com/openai/gym#installation)
 
There's a more detailed installation guide [here](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/issues/1)

The materials are based on [Practical RL course](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL). 
You can also find more detailed versions of lectures/seminars there (see week0 & week1).
